        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Originally, I followed a Red Velvet Cheesecake Cookies recipe from <a href="https://ashbaber.com/">Ash Baber</a>.</p>
        <p>I adjusted the recipe to suit the earl grey flavour and it is so good. Especially, I love the addition of walnuts, unless you have nut allergy. Also, I use the loose tea leaves from the earl grey teabags.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <p>Yields around 12 cookies</p>

        <h3>Cream Cheese Filling</h3>

            <li>40g sugar</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons corn flour</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
            <li>8g earl grey tea leaves</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Cookie Dough</h3>

            <li>240g unsalted butter, <strong>cold</strong>, cut into small cubes</li>
            <li>120g sugar</li>
            <li>240g soft light brown sugar</li>
            <li>4 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>2 egg yolks</li>
            <li>520g all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>40g corn flour</li>
            <li>24g earl grey tea leaves</li>

            <li>240g walnuts, chopped</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <p>* Prepare the cream cheese filling a few hours</p>
        <ol>
            <h3>Cream Cheese Filling</h3>
            <li>In a bowl, add all the ingredients for the filling and mix together until smooth.</li>
            <li>Add 1 teaspoon sized dollops of this filling onto a plate or tray, you want 12 dollops. Place these into your freezer for a few hours.</li>
        
            <h3>Cookie Dough</h3>
            <li>In a large bowl, add the cold butter, both sugars and the vanilla. Beat these together for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the eggs and egg yolks. Mix until combined.</li>
            <li>In a separate bowl, mix together the all-purpose flour, corn flour, earl grey tea leaves, baking powder and salt.</li>
            <li>Add this into your other bowl, along with the walnuts. Mix just until a dough forms and you can no longer see any flour.</li>
            <li>Get 120g of this dough and flatten it out. Add a piece of your frozen filling to the centre of this, then roll the cookie dough into a ball, making sure the filling is fully covered.</li>
            <li>Place this onto a plate or tray, then repeat until you have used all of your cookie dough.</li>
            <li>Leave these cookie dough balls in your freezer for at least 1 hour.</li>

            <h3>Baking</h3>
            <li>About 20 minutes before you are going to bake the cookies, pre-heat your oven to 220 C (428 F). Also line a large baking tray with some baking paper.</li>
            <li>Place your frozen cookie dough balls onto this tray, making sure to leave gaps between them so they have room to spread.</li>
            <li>Bake for around 18-20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Leave them to cool on the tray for about 15-20 minutes to set up. Then after, you can enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
